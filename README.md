# Ridesharing App

Ridesharing app is a carpool application which allows an Andelan car owner to give a ride to another Andelan who does not have a car or who is not feeling like driving his/her own personal car. The two major steps involved in the application are the ride offer process (which allows a car owner makes his/her car open to colleagues who may be interested in riding with him/her)  and ride request process (which allows a colleague without a car to ask for a ride from the car owners heading to his/her route).
